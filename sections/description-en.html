<span class="markdown">
This ontology has five classes: Main_Repository, Backup_Folder, Macroareas_Folder, SingleFile and SingleFolder. The classes were chosen according to the concepts which needed to be represented. All classes are children of Main_Repository which, in the case of my internship project, corresponds to the hard disk, namely, the storing object. As far as the object properties are concerned, belongsTo is applicable to a folder or a file, which usually belong to a main folder, which is their father; containsFile defines the file which is stored in a folder; containsFolder defines the folder which is stored in another folder. As far as the data properties are concerned, containsFiles defines all the files which are contained in a folder, writing the information concerning them as a string; dc:description allows to write a brief description of the file or folder, taking into consideration its contents and history; dc:format is used to define the format of a single file; dc:type allows to define the type of the file, which is different from the format. A file type can simply be a directory, for example, whereas the format requires to state the file extension; hasSize allows to describe the size that the file occupies; organizedInto allows to define how elements are organized inside a biggerfolder.</span>
